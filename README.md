# k8s ?
  is an open-source container orchestration platform. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
  Key features of Kubernetes include:

  . Container Orchestration: 
  Kubernetes allows you to define how your applications should run and scale, and it takes care of deploying and managing containers accordingly.

  . Automated Scaling: 
  Kubernetes can automatically scale the number of container instances based on the demand for the application, ensuring optimal resource utilization.

  . Load Balancing: 
  It provides built-in load balancing to distribute network traffic among containers, ensuring efficient use of resources and high availability.

  . Self-healing: If a container or a node fails, Kubernetes can automatically reschedule and restart containers on healthy nodes to maintain application availability.

Declarative Configuration: You can define your application's desired state using YAML or JSON files, and Kubernetes will work to make the current state match the desired state.

Service Discovery and Load Balancing: Kubernetes can discover services and distribute incoming network traffic to them, enabling communication between different parts of an application.

Rolling Updates and Rollbacks: Kubernetes facilitates rolling updates to applications, allowing you to update your application without downtime. If issues arise, it supports rolling back to a previous version.

Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Cloud Deployments: Kubernetes is cloud-agnostic, meaning it can be deployed on various cloud providers or on-premises. This makes it suitable for multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments.
